The other hook types are here just as examples, they are not saved as live scripts in this repository.\n",

    "## Installing the Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The following describes the manual method. This is, however, necessary only for edits of a pre-commit script file. For other hooks, like the post-commit, we have implemented an automatic installation of the hooks in the install-hooks.sh file (in the hooks-accessories folder). This installation file is called before every commit from the pre-commit hook, to update the hook scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the installation, one needs to copy the hooks files from the 'hooks/' folder to the '.git/hooks/' folder. This can be done by executing the 'install-hooks.sh' Bash script. When changing from Windows to Unix systems, the following line ending conversion might be necessary first, though. In general, most errors occured to us when wrong line endings were applied to bash scripts, and they were attempted to be run from mismatched systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following should also be done automatically by the install-hooks.sh. In case the automatic script doesn't work from the pre-commit, run it manually. On some combinations of systems or environments, after the hooks are copied, it might be necessary to run the following command to convert the Windows-style line endings (CRLF) to Unix-style line endings (LF). Otherwise the script won't execute properly, or not at all. The hooks need to be copied to the hooks folder and used before the git commits and converts the line endings itself. The line endings of the scripts need to match the environment that we're commiting from. So, for example, if the hook script was edited on a Windows system, copied to the '.git/hooks/' folder, but not treated with line endings for Linux, and then a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal is used to commit the files, it will throw an error about the hooks. Because the WSL expects LF endings, while the scripts have CRLF endings.\n",

    "# Run in a Git Bash terminal\n",

    "\n",
    "The `pre-commit` hook is a hook that runs before a commit is made. We can use it to check code quality, run tests, or enforce coding standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A Python project is using Continuous Integration (CI) to run tests and deploy code. Developers want to ensure that code pushed to the repository passes all tests before it reaches the CI stage.\n",

    " - Code Coverage: Check code coverage to ensure that enough of the code is being tested.\n",
    " - Static Analysis: Use flake8 to enforce coding standards.\n",

    "### How to Implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-commit hook is already implemented in this repo. But in theory, if someone needed to make a new pre-commit on their system manually, here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the hooks directory: `cd .git/hooks`\n",
    "2. Create a new file: `touch pre-commit`\n",
    "3. Make it executable: `chmod +x pre-commit`\n",

    "\n",
    "The `post-commit` hook is a hook that runs after a commit has been made. It can do various things after the commit, ranging from simply displaying a custom message if the commit was successful, running any post-commit tests and changes, logging, automatically pushing, notifications, etc. In this repository, we have a working post-commit script that displays a few messages after the commit. It also updates a log file with a new entry, and a notification is sent to Slack and Discord. An automatic push is commented out for safety purposes, as we deemed it risky.\n",

In order not to publicly share these in this repository, we git-crypt the hooks-accessories/secret.txt file where we store the variables SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL and DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL. Git-crypt will automatically encrypt files that need to be kept secret, such as our secret.txt. A working environment with correctly set up git-crypt and GPG keys is needed for encrypting and decrypting this file. The git-crypt method is more complicated on Windows, since one has to run the git commands from the WSL environment where the git-crypt is installed (a global Windows installation has questionable support). A drawback of using git-crypt in a repo is that when one does not have a functioning git-crypt local environment, no commits are possible in the git repo, unless one deletes the .git-crypt folder from the repo and maybe comment out the .pitattributes git-crypt line.\n",
