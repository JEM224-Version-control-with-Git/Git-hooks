It can do various things after the commit, ranging from simply displaying a custom message if the commit was successful, running any post-commit tests and changes, automatically pushing, logging, notifications, etc. In this repository, we have a working post-commit script that displays a few messages after the commit. It also checks with the working directory if there are any additional changes that were not staged and warns the user about those. A log file is updated with a new entry, and a notification is sent to an email."
