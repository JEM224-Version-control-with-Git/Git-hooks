    "## Installing the hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The following describes the manual method. This is, however, necessary only for edits of a pre-commit script file. For other hooks, like the post-commit, we have implemented an automatic installation of the hooks in the install-hooks.sh file. This installation file is called before every commit from the pre-commit hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For installation, one needs to copy the hooks files from the 'hooks/' folder to the '.git/hooks/' folder. This can be done by executing the 'install-hooks.sh' Bash script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Git Bash, and type in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash install-hooks.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the installation has been successful, navigate to the '.git/hooks/' folder and check for our hook files, for example if the post-commit file is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following should also be done automatically by the install-hooks.sh. In case it doesn't do that manually. On some combinations of systems or environments, after the hooks are copied, it might be necessary to run the following command to convert the Windows-style line endings (CRLF) to Unix-style line endings (LF). Otherwise the script won't execute properly, or not at all. The hooks need to be copied to the hooks folder and used before the git commits and converts the line endings itself. The line endings of the scripts need to match the environment that we're commiting from. So, for example, if the hook script was edited on a Windows system, copied to the '.git/hooks/' folder, but not treated with line endings for Linux, and then a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal is used to commit the files, it will throw an error about the hooks. Because the WSL expects LF endings, while the scripts have CRLF endings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following so the hooks can be executed on Unix-like systems:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run in a (WSL) Bash terminal\n",
    "dos2unix .git/hooks/post-commit\n",
    "dos2unix .git/hooks/pre-commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, alternatively, the reverse scenario could happen, a Windows user needing to use a script that has LF endings and Git not converting them, yet.\n",
    "Run the following so the hooks can be executed on Windows-style systems:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run in a Git Bash terminal\n",
    "unix2dos .git/hooks/post-commit\n",
    "unix2dos .git/hooks/pre-commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "This could be automated in a pre-commit hook, for the other commits. But we're not sure yet, how to solve the automation for the pre-commit hook itself."
